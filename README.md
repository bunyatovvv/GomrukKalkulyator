<h3 align="left">Technologies</h3>

* Single-Activity architecture
 
**MVVM**
> Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls.

**Retrofit**
> Retrofit is an easy and fast library to retrieve and upload data via a REST-based web service. Retrofit manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.

**OkHttp 3**
> OkHttp3 is a library that works in conjunction with java.io and java. nio to make data access, storage, and processing considerably easier. It started as a component of OkHttp. Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Java and Android application development.

**Room Database**
> Room is a persistent library that is part of the Android jetpack. It is built on top of SQLite. The room persistent library has many advantages over raw SQLite.

**Kotlin Coroutines**
> Coroutines are light-weight threads that allow you to write asynchronous non-blocking code. Kotlin provides the kotlinx. coroutines library with a number of high-level coroutine-enabled primitives.

**Kotlin Flow**
> Flow API in Kotlin is a better way to handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.

**Navigation Components**
> Navigation refers to the interactions that let users navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.

**View Bindnig**
> View binding is a feature that makes it easier to write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.

**Dependency Injection (Dagger-Hilt)**
> Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application. The goals of Hilt are: To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps. To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, readability/understanding, and code sharing between apps.

**LiveData**
> LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.

**DiffUtil**
> DiffUtil is a utility class that calculates the difference between two lists and outputs a list of update operations that converts the first list into the second one. It can be used to calculate updates for a RecyclerView Adapter.

**Material Design**
> Material Design is an Android-oriented design language created by Google, supporting onscreen touch experiences via cue-rich features and natural motions that mimic real-world objects. Designers optimize users' experience with 3D effects, realistic lighting and animation features in immersive, platform-consistent GUIs.
